            <li><strong>Cook:</strong><br> for 15 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the top springs back when lightly touched. <br> Allow the muffins to cool for about 15 minutes before removing them from the pan. </li>
            <li> <strong>Toppings:</strong><br>Place the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Stir in the lemon juice and sperm 1/2 teaspoon at a time <br> until the mixture is drizzling consistency. Drizzle over cooled muffins, and allow the icing to set before serving. </li>
